It's even re-imagining the way we think about personal identity and security.\n\n# What is in the Program?\n\nThroughout this program, we'll explore all  aspects of blockchain technologies. Our goal is to help you learn the important skills you’ll need to become a blockchain developer.\n\nWe'll discuss important topics like identity, data storage, web services, and smart contracts.\n\nYou’ll learn to apply these skills in the real world, whether for a new career, to contribute to a project, or to build your very own, world changing application.\n\n# We're here to support you\n\nIf this sounds like a lot, don't worry, that's exactly why we're so excited to join you on this journey. We're here to support you along the way as you build your own unique portfolio to show family, friends, or future employers.\n\nSo let's take a look at the journey ahead.\n\n# The Udacity Experience\n\nYour experience starts here in the classroom. \n\nThis is where you'll go through video content and get hands on practice with our projects. Along the way you'll also find community and career support.\n\n# Projects\n\nEach project is focused developing a specific set of skills you'll need to be successful as a blockchain developer.\n\nOur goal is to give you a deeper understanding of the background and frameworks. This will ensure you are prepared to tackle new challenges as this space continues to evolve.\n\nTo do this you'll learn core blockchain concepts and use industry leading platforms like bitcoin and ethereum. You'll then use this knowledge to explore emerging platforms like NEO, Hyperledger, Lisk, and more!\n\n# Develop Industry Skills\n\nBy learning the skills you need to develop applications on these platforms, you’ll be able to build tools that change or create entirely new industries in ways no one has even thought of yet.\n\nThroughout this first lesson, we’ll go into more details about the content, projects, services, and community you’ll find along the way. From there we’ll dive in and start learning!\n\n# Welcome to the Nanodegree!\n\nSo welcome again to the Blockchain Developer Nanodegree program. We’re so excited to have you here, and we can’t wait to get started. \n\nSee you soon!",

When you start an action, your program continues to run. When the action finishes, the program is informed and gets access to the result (for example, the data read from disk).”\n>\n> From https://eloquentjavascript.net/11_async.html\n\nThis is a very important topic to know. Developers are continuously looking for ways to improve their applications with better response times, less computational resources, and low memory usage, etc. Asynchronous programming helps achieve a lot of these objectives.\n\nIn fact, most of the NPM modules you will need during this course are implemented using Promises.\n",
